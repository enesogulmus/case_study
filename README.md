# case_study

A case study project.
I developed which shows the most popular article for last seven days and short by the published date.

## Getting Started


This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
I wanted to Riverpod State Management in this project.
I created core layer in the begining.
Core layer contains api classes, network certificate, constants which such as domain and api key, api status extensions, model and color class 
I imported DM Sans font in this project.
I created a bit component for UI.
I crated a splash screen.
I created a home screen and article detail screen.
I developed this project using MVVM pattern.
I created widget_test.dart. It is include for whole project.
However test_widget do not run properly because I write viewModel function as returning Future<void> so test unfourtunatetly successfully completed but if I return GetMostPopular model if it is succesful.

## How to run 
flutter run 
## How to test
flutter test
## How to build an apk

If you need to help you run basicly under the sh directiory for this command.
